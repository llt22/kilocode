# 🚀 Kilo (Fork)

> **This is a fork of [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)** with the following enhancement:
>
> ### ✅ Restored XML Tool Protocol Selection
> The upstream removed XML tool protocol support ([d00d9ed](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/d00d9ed)). This fork restores it, allowing models that don't support native tools to continue working with XML protocol. A tool protocol selector is available in the API settings UI.

> Kilo is the all-in-one agentic engineering platform. Build, ship, and iterate faster with the most popular open source coding agent.
> #1 on OpenRouter. 1.5M+ Kilo Coders. 25T+ tokens processed

## Get Started in Visual Studio Code

1. Install the Kilo Code extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kilocode.Kilo-Code).
2. Create your account to access 500+ cutting-edge AI models including Gemini 3 Pro, Claude 4.5 Sonnet & Opus, and GPT-5 – with transparent pricing that matches provider rates exactly.
3. Start coding with AI that adapts to your workflow. Watch our quick-start guide to see Kilo in action:

## Get Started with the CLI

```bash
# npm
npm install -g @kilocode/cli

# Or run directly with npx
npx @kilocode/cli
```

Then run `kilo` in any project directory to start.

### Autonomous Mode (CI/CD)

Use the `--auto` flag with `kilo run` to enable fully autonomous operation without user interaction. This is ideal for CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows:

```bash
kilo run --auto "run tests and fix any failures"
```

**Important:** The `--auto` flag disables all permission prompts and allows the agent to execute any action without confirmation. Only use this in trusted environments like CI/CD pipelines.
